# HR Analytics Dashboard

A minimalist Python terminal application designed for "People Analytics" and employee management. This project was built as part of **Project Week III** at Harbour.Space University.

## 🎯 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to manage a small database of employees using core Python data structures without the use of functions or external libraries. It demonstrates "Full-Stack Data" logic by implementing a manual query engine for a list of dictionaries.

## 🛠 Features
- **Data Visualization**: View a formatted list of all current employees.
- **Data Entry**: Add new employees with specific attributes (Name, Department, Salary).
- **Data Mutation**: Remove employees from the database by name using search logic.
- **Data Aggregation**: Calculate real-time company-wide average salary statistics.

## 📋 Requirements & Constraints
To demonstrate a deep understanding of Python logic, this project adheres to the following strict academic restrictions:
- **No User-Defined Functions**: All logic is handled within a single main execution loop.
- **Manual Data Handling**: Sorting and searching are built "by hand" using loops and conditionals rather than built-in methods where possible.
- **Data Structures**: Centralized use of **Lists** for record sequences and **Dictionaries** for key-value attribute mapping.
